# Building an API for a Machine Learning model with Swagger

Your Machine Learning Model is Accurate, Now What?. 
The ability to deploy these models as APIs that end users can interact with is just as crucial. In this repo we explore the process of creating an API for a machine learning model using [Swagger,](https://swagger.io/) demonstrating how to share and integrate this endpoint into a production environment so that your model doesn't just end in a Juputer notebook. We'll also test the API and highlight the benefits of such an approach.

We use a synthethic data that predicts the probability of a customer to make a purchase of a product based on features like income, savings, age, credit score, whether a customer subscribed to a marketing campaign before or not. But building a great model is only half the battle. To realize its full potential, it needs to be shared with end users so that so then can interact with it. In this case, you can think of it as a model that helps marketing teams to identify potential customers who are more likely to make a purchase, allowing them to target their campaigns more effectively.
